<p>
    Smoked Pork is one of the most loved traditional dishes of Nagaland. It is made by curing pork over a wood fire for several days, which gives it a rich smoky flavor and helps in preservation.

The smoked pork is often cooked with dry bamboo shoots, axone (fermented soybean), or local herbs and chilies. It is usually enjoyed with steamed rice and is an essential part of Naga feasts and daily meals.

This dish reflects the Naga people's love for natural ingredients, smoked flavors, and traditional cooking techniques.

    <p>
      Bamboo Stew is a traditional and nutritious dish popular among the tribes of Nagaland. It is made using tender bamboo shoots, often cooked with meat (like chicken or pork), local herbs, and spices.

The bamboo gives the stew a slightly tangy flavor and a unique aroma. It is valued not just for its taste but also for its digestive and medicinal properties.

Usually served hot with steamed rice, Bamboo Stew is a perfect example of tribal cooking using fresh forest ingredients.
