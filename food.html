  <h1>Famous Foods of Assam</h1>

  <div class="food">
    <h2>Kachori</h2>

<p>
    Kachori is a popular and iconic snack in Uttar Pradesh, known for its crispy, flaky crust and spicy, flavorful fillings. Often enjoyed as a breakfast item or street food, it is served hot with aloo sabzi (spiced potato curry) and tangy chutneys, making it an irresistible treat.

There are many varieties, but the most famous is the “Banarasi Kachori”, stuffed with spiced lentils or urad dal, deep-fried to golden perfection. In cities like Varanasi, Mathura, and Kanpur, mornings begin with the tempting aroma of fresh kachoris from local shops.

Kachori is more than just food—it’s a cultural experience, often paired with jalebi for a sweet-and-spicy combo, and enjoyed during festivals, family gatherings, and temple offerings.

Whether eaten on a bustling street corner or at a traditional home kitchen, kachori captures the bold and hearty flavors of Uttar Pradesh.

    <h2> Tunday Kabab</h2>

    <p>
        Tunday Kabab is a legendary Mughlai delicacy from Lucknow, the city of Nawabs. Famous for its ultra-soft texture and aromatic spices, it is a variety of galouti kabab—originally created for a toothless Nawab who desired meat that required no chewing.

Made with finely minced buffalo or lamb meat (sometimes chicken), the kababs are blended with over 100 exotic spices, including rose water, kewra, cardamom, and saffron. What makes them unique is the secret family recipe passed down through generations since the 17th century.

The most iconic place to try it is the Tunday Kababi shop in Aminabad, Lucknow, which has become a cultural symbol of Awadhi cuisine. Served hot with rumali roti, mint chutney, and onions, every bite is soft, spicy, and full of royal flavor.

Tunday Kabab isn’t just food—it’s a historic culinary experience that showcases the richness of Uttar Pradesh’s nawabi heritage.
