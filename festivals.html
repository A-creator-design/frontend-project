  <h1>Famous Festivals of Odisha</h1>

  <div class="festivals">
    <h2>Rath Yatra</h2>

  <p>
  Rath Yatra is a world-famous Hindu festival celebrated every year in Puri, Odisha, in honor of Lord Jagannath, along with his siblings Balabhadra and Subhadra.

During the festival, the deities are taken out of the Jagannath Temple and placed on huge wooden chariots, which are pulled by thousands of devotees through the streets to the Gundicha Temple.

The event symbolizes Lord Jagannath's annual visit to his aunt's home and reflects devotion, unity, and joy. Millions of pilgrims and tourists from around the world attend this vibrant and spiritual celebration.

Rath Yatra is not just a festival — it’s an emotion and a moving temple on wheels.

    <h2>Nuakhai</h2>

    <p> 
        Nuakhai is a traditional harvest festival celebrated in Western Odisha, especially in the Sambalpur region. The name means “Nua” (new) + “Khai” (food) — symbolizing the eating of newly harvested rice.

Celebrated just after Ganesh Chaturthi, it is a day of community bonding, gratitude to nature, and respect to elders. People offer the first grain of the harvest to the family deity and then enjoy a festive meal together.

Nuakhai reflects the agrarian roots, cultural pride, and unity of the people of Odisha.
